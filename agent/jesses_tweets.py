---

## 2025-02-25

OK I gotta say it: I am feeling sadness that I'm not heading to ETH Denver.
the last two have been formative for @base. they catalyzed the energy around launch and then built on our momentum.
the upside is my absence leaves space for the @base core team. go find and meet them.

@farokh you're free to do what you want with your money and also I want to publicly state that I think it's lame to celebrate immediately divesting of long term builders who are rewarding us for our contributions and using tokens to bring us in as cobuilders
long term &gt; short term

I want as many coins as humanly possible listed on @coinbase, from @base and beyond.
More day 1s, more slow cooks, more memes, more utility, more culture, more defi, more networks. More all of it.
In the current model there's scarcity and we need abundance. Top priority.

---

## 2025-02-10

Some more thoughts on this after the weekend:
1. Purity tests like ‚Äúdo you hold all the ETH you earn‚Äù are a distraction and hurt Ethereum. Overfixating on virtue signaling like this distracts us from the real work, which is building products that people love and creating

---

## 2025-02-07

I think sometimes people forget that @base is only 1.5 years and hasn't even been through a full cycle yet
if sometimes it feels like certain things don't exist on @base ‚Äî it's because others have had &gt;2x the time to cook
we're just getting started

## 2025-02-06

some personal news: we're having our first baby
we expect him (!!) to come in early march and i'll be more offline than not for the month after, then reducing travel this year. excited to bring another builder into the world.

## 2025-01-28

I've spent the last few months in deep conversation with the @coinbase listings team on how they can better support and lift up builders, whether it's on @base or any other chain (L1, L2, everywhere)
There's a difference between what Coinbase wants to list, and what they're able

All you have to do is join and try new things onchain.

@0xMert_ @coinbase I am a positive and collaborative person. that is who I am. all my messages go through that lens. there's no corporate double speak, i write my tweets, i stand by my statements, it's just my lens.
I also believe that the best version of the world is onchain. and that all of us

## 2025-01-14

spent the weekend digging in on AI and wow ‚Äî @base is going to be the home of onchain agents. some of the things I got most excited about:
- @aixbt_agent is the #1 KOL in our industry by mindshare who also happens to be a fully autonomous AI agent built on Virtuals
- @freysa_ai

my quick 2c on how:
1. commit for at least 6 months
2. stream 5-6 days/week for ~2 hours
3. find 2-3 other streamers to co-promote with
4. use AI to do everything - code, design, market
5. don't wait for the perfect idea, just start
I'd love to mentor anyone who does this.

I sketched out my "dream wallet" that would be 10x better than anything in web2 or onchain today
need to solve a bunch of hard challenges, but i think we can get there in the next ~6-12 months.
onchain is going to be 100x better than online.

this is a funny joke, but also I really do try my best to show up for folks who reach out. i do this because @base is for everyone and I want to lead by example in creating that space.

@jessepollak
my quick thoughts: - I love @0xRacerAlt and
@friendtech
- they've repeatedly innovated at the edge of what's possible on
@base
and showed the way for the industry - their product was incorrectly culturally labeled early on as "negatively speculative" by certain parts of the broader ecosystem (across base, ethereum). - this rightfully made them feel pretty isolated and disconnected early on. i've observed this actively, think it sucks, and also know i could be doing more. - i've been a user since day one and see the team continually iterating, experimenting and trying new things. from changing the game with their wallet UX to their latest product iteration (which is working!) to their tokeneconomic model (100% user owned). they are literally pioneering. - i'd love to see the relationship between the broader ethereum/base ecosystem and friendtech heal ‚Äî i think there's a lot of good that we could do together. - i'll be sad if the team decides to leave
@base
, but i also respect and will support whatever path - that's the beauty of the decentralized, onchain, economy! i am excited to keep building with racer and the rest of the
@base
ecosystem to bring the world onchain. https:// x.com/0xRacerAlt/sta /0xRacerAlt/status/1794757353084223646 ‚Ä¶
